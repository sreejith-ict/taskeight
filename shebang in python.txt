The shebang is added in the first line of the python program. The interpreter used for a file is saved in the shebang.
So inorder to run the python code without python command, we first make this code file executable.
For this, we open the terminal and enter 'chmod +x hello.py'. And 
now we can directly run the script by entering './hello.py'.
